Check the "todo" strings in the code

Use the ZKB API as plugin? Swissquote? CS?

Separate data and packages. Provide a search-path for the data (input and output). Same as for the marketdata.

Investment, account also as plugin...? Subpackage? Sensible?  Might depend on the API?

Clean up the account and investment-parsers?

Convert to f-strings, get rid of the plus-signs. Use the linter? Use grep?

Is if name == main the right thing for module-level debugging? How to do better testing? ==> Rather use unittest...

Finalize the marketdata-branch:
- Test if the splits work, e.g., with AAPL or AUUSI (use your data, though)
- Compare your data with what the newest branch outputs - are the plots the same?
- Read todos, finalize documentation
- Update version number
