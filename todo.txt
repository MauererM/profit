Check the "todo" strings in the code


Use the ZKB API as plugin? Swissquote? CS?


Separate data and packages. Provide a search-path for the data (input and output). Same as for the marketdata.

Investment, account also as plugin...? Subpackage? Sensible? 

Check out the logging module for debug-outputs

Make all imports absolute: import profit.stringoperations etc.

Migrate to pathlib for path-string operations

Convert to f-strings, get rid of the plus-signs

Do a def main if name == main in the main-script

Is if name == main the right thing for module-level debugging?


Continue in marketdata: 
- Allow weird IDs like ^Gdaxi or so (maybe also update the regex-check... maybe not needed for file names?). What does the asset-parsers do with weird characters in the assets (try out !AAPL or so as symbol...!)
- It's almost working. Test these cases:
- Marketdata with empty/full folders at startup
- Is the correct data being pulled from data providers?
- Is sometimes data _not_ pulled?
- Is the data correctly merged?
- Is the storage-data being overwritten (or not)? 
- Check the todos.
