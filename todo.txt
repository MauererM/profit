Check the "todo" strings in the code


Use the ZKB API as plugin? Swissquote? CS?

Organize marketdata also as better plugin. Initialize + verify the storage. Add a header. Download less data if marketdata is there. Include splits (in header)? Create a more complex header? Allow a little bit of interpolation to reduce frequent retrievals? Sanitize input well. CSV is OK. Verify content often. Cleaner plugin/sub-package interface. Modularity. 

Separate data and packages. Provide a search-path for the data (input and output). Same as for the marketdata.

Investment, account also as plugin...? Subpackage? Sensible? 

Check out the logging module for debug-outputs

Make all imports absolute: import profit.stringoperations etc.
Migrate to pathlib for path-string operations

Convert to f-strings, get rid of the plus-signs

Do a def main if name == main in the main-script

Is if name == main the right thing for module-level debugging?
