Check the "todo" strings in the code


Use the ZKB API as plugin? Swissquote? CS?


Separate data and packages. Provide a search-path for the data (input and output). Same as for the marketdata.

Investment, account also as plugin...? Subpackage? Sensible? 

Check out the logging module for debug-outputs

Convert to f-strings, get rid of the plus-signs

Is if name == main the right thing for module-level debugging? How to do better testing?

Change the parsers also to pathlib


Continue in marketdata: 
- Test if the IDs work, with weird symbols. Fix it for the indexes. 
- It's almost working. Test these cases:

- Is the correct data being pulled from data providers?
- Is sometimes data _not_ pulled?
- Is the data correctly merged?
- Is the storage-data being overwritten (or not)? 
- Check the todos. 
- Something is shady; Large spikes in investment-values. Why?
