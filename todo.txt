Check the "todo" strings in the code


Use the ZKB API as plugin? Swissquote? CS?

Organize marketdata also as better plugin. Initialize + verify the storage. Add a header. Download less data if marketdata is there. Include splits (in header)? Create a more complex header? Allow a little bit of interpolation to reduce frequent retrievals? Sanitize input well. CSV is OK. Verify content often. Cleaner plugin/sub-package interface. Modularity. 

Separate data and packages. Provide a search-path for the data (input and output). Same as for the marketdata.

Investment, account also as plugin...? Subpackage? Sensible?
